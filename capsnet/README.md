###Usage:####
#  Run capsnetv2.py to dump the best weights during training. Use the shell script
#  Once weights are dumped run capsnetv3.py to load the best weights and run on your test case

#  capsnetv2.py should generate a results folder where the weights are dumped. The last weight is the best weight on validation set

#  For us validation and test set are the same
